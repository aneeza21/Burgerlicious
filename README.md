# Developer Documentation
It cannot be written by someone without programming skills; it is always written by the developer. Additionally, it is more social than technical and teaches other programmers how to work with code. Everything will be sorted and organised using wikis, and the design document contains the developer documentation.  

# Demos, Screenshots, Videos, and Example Output
# Hosting
Hosting is the place where the project will be placed so that everyone can access it, so we will put our project in GitHub because it is an open source project and free so that everyone can access it from users and developers to give us feedback.

# Codes of Conduct
The Ruby code of conduct serves as the basis for the Aneeza's Burgers code of conduct. You can report any infractions of the code of conduct to AneezaBurgers1999@gmail.com.

# Announcing
It is one of the most crucial tasks for our project, and it will appear on the cover page with a few keywords and a brief phrase. Since it is a course project, we won't be making the announcement to the public; instead, we will keep it confidential.
