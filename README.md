# Starting from What You Have

Burgerlicious is meant to be an open-source project that developers can contribute to and refine to the best of their amenities. A part of this project's members had been working on it before stated that this project is the continuation of the ITSE305 project which implies that we have a laid-out plan that now needs implementation in a real-world environment. The forthcoming improvements in the system will place a premium on refining and simplifying inventory procedures, fine-tuning marketing strategies, and enhancing the efficiency of food preparation processes, the objective of the new system is to enhance customer service by exceeding their expectations.

# Choose a Good Name: write how you did that

Deciding a name for a project is one of the most critical initial aspects of a project as it is the name through which everyone will recognize this project. it should somewhat include what the project is about so the people looking at it can easily remember the functionality and features of the project itself. it should not collide with the name of an existing project as people can easily mistake either one for the other. A poll was created in the name selection process and the one with the most votes was selected.


# State That the Project is Free

The software will be open source, and it will be released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). There are multiple ways to enlighten everyone that this is an open-source project
- It will be clearly stated on the homepage of the website that this is an open-source project.
- Embedding a GitHub badge on the website to show the recent developments and ongoing repairs in the project.
- License badge can be included on the homepage so no one lacks certainty of what the project is.

# Maintaining a FAQ
# Developer Documentation
It cannot be written by someone without programming skills; it is always written by the developer. Additionally, it is more social than technical and teaches other programmers how to work with code. Everything will be sorted and organized using wikis, and the design document will contain the developer documentation.  

# Demos, Screenshots, Videos, and Example Output
