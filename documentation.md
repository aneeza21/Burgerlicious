# Documentation

The documentation for the Aneeza Burgers Restaurant Management System project provides an initial overview of our progress and accomplishments, although it may not be complete yet. It aims to give readers insights into the tasks and responsibilities of our contributors. While the documentation is a work in progress, it serves as a starting point for understanding the project and its expected outcomes. It will be regularly updated and improved by our dedicated team of moderators and contributors. We appreciate feedback and suggestions to enhance the documentation. Thank you for your support and involvement in the Aneeza Burger project!
