ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT ▶️ - middle of development of beta
The project team of the restaurant management system is continually developing, testing, and fine-tuning features during the implementation phase. 
Alignment with project timeframes and objectives is ensured through regular meetings and progress tracking. 
The system has completed its basic design and first functionality using an iterative process, whereby each implemented function is released to the repository. 
Developers and other participants are welcome to join the ongoing project, which promotes teamwork for the system's complete implementation and continual enhancement based on insightful user input.
